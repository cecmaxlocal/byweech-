### Component Overview

*   **📱 `App`**: The native mobile application for iOS and Android. [**TODO**: Add tech stack, e.g., "Built with Flutter and Dart."]
*   **💻 `Client`**: Contains shared logic, type definitions, or an SDK used by the `Web`, `App`, and `Desktop` clients to communicate with the servers.
*   **🖥️ `Desktop`**: The cross-platform desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux. [**TODO**: Add tech stack, e.g., "Built with Electron and TypeScript."]
*   **📄 `Doc`**: Houses all project documentation, including API specifications, architectural decision records (ADRs), and user guides.
*   **🖼️ `Image`**: A centralized location for all static image assets, ensuring consistency across all platforms.
*   **☁️ `Servers`**: The backend infrastructure, likely composed of multiple microservices. [**TODO**: Add tech stack, e.g., "Powered by Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, and containerized with Docker."]
*   **🌐 `Web`**: The main web-based client application. [**TODO**: Add tech stack, e.g., "A Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite."]

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following tools installed on your system.
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (for running servers)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/.byweech.git
    cd .byweech
    ```

2.  **Install Web Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd Web/
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Server Dependencies:**
    Navigate to each service in the `Servers/` directory and install its dependencies.
    ```sh
    cd ../Servers/service-core/
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Most components will require environment variables. Copy the example file and fill in your local configuration.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    (Repeat this for each component that has a `.env.example` file).

## 🏃 Usage

[**TODO:** Provide clear instructions on how to run each part of your application.]

### Running the Backend Servers

From the `Servers/` directory (or project root if you have a top-level `docker-compose.yml`):
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

### Running the Web Application

From the `Web/` directory:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Launching the Desktop Application

From the `Desktop/` directory:
```sh
npm start
```

[**TODO:** Add screenshots or GIFs showing your application in action.]
